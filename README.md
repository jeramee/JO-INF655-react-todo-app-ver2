**Author:** Jeramee Oliver

**Course:** INF 655 - Front-end Development II

## Project Overview

The task involves improving a React To-Do List application with nested sub-tasks, unique identifiers, and improved task form. Prop drilling is used for task details, and a user-friendly interface is created. The submission requires sharing the GitHub repository link for public review.

## Files

- **src/components/Task.js:** The main React component representing a single task in the to-do list.
- **src/components/TaskInputForm.js:** Form component for adding new tasks.
- **src/App.js:** Main component managing the list of tasks and rendering Task components.
- **src/App.css:** Stylesheet for basic styling.
- **public/index.html:** HTML template for the React application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project.
